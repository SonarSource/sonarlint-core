<h4>Never Trust User Input</h4>
<p>
    Applications must treat all user input and, more generally, all third-party data as
    attacker-controlled data.
</p>
<p>
    The application must determine where the third-party data comes from and treat that data
    source as an attack vector. Two rules apply:
</p>

<p>
    First, before using it in the application&apos;s business logic, the application must
    validate the attacker-controlled data against predefined formats, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Character sets</li>
    <li>Sizes</li>
    <li>Types</li>
    <li>Or any strict schema</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Second, the application must sanitize string data before inserting it into interpreted
    contexts (client-side code, file paths, SQL queries). Unsanitized code can corrupt the
    application&apos;s logic.
</p>
