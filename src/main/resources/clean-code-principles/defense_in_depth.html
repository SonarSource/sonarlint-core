<h4>Defense-In-Depth</h4>
<p>
    Applications and infrastructure benefit greatly from relying on multiple security mechanisms
    layered on top of each other. If one security mechanism fails, there is a high probability
    that the subsequent layers of security will successfully defend against the attack.
</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of these code protection ramparts includes the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Minimizing the attack surface of the code</li>
    <li>Application of the principle of least privilege</li>
    <li>Validation and sanitization of data</li>
    <li>Encrypting incoming, outgoing, or stored data with secure cryptography</li>
    <li>Ensuring that internal errors cannot disrupt the overall runtime</li>
    <li>Separation of tasks and access to information</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note that these layers must be simple enough to use in an everyday workflow. Security
    measures should not break usability.
